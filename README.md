# Chatdle

This is supposed to be a chatbot based Wordle cope for Twitch streamers and chatters.

It is under development still. I now have the base class game and a flask base to start working from. Still needs the graphics, chat integration and a control panel.

My vision is to have few entry modes: Raw chaos mode and democracy mode, where guesses are polled and then entered.
